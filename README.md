# Human-Activity-Recognition-using-RNNs-in-Smartphones



#### Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to build a `machine learning model` and a `signal processing pipeline` in offline mode capable of processing signals collected using smart phone inertial sensors and producing useful datasets will be used as inputs of a machine learning model capable of recognizing some of human daily activities (sitting, walking...)
